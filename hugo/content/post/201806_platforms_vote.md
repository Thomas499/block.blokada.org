During May we've been running the platforms vote, which is part of my strategic planning of the Blokada future. Needless to say, this is very long term, since there's a lot of things to implement on Android still, but, it's always good to check what do you think. Especially because you are always keen on giving your feedback. :)

This time we had **1039 responses**, which is much more than before, although this survey was running for longer time than the previous ones. This was a multiple choice survey, so one participant could vote on more than one feature (and there was no maximum limit). In total, there was **2595 votes**. Unsurprisingly _Android_ was your top choice. I included it in the survey as a sanity check mostly ;).

What is interesting though, is the fact that you rank _Windows_ (23%), and _Linux_ (16%) so high. This is a good sign for future expansion of Blokada, although for the foreseeable future I plan to put the focus on mobile platforms. From this perspective, it's good to see that _Android TV / Fire stick_ got a decent amount of votes (14%), even  more than _iOS_ (13%).

The second question was meant to probe the popularity of iOS among you. This was an optional question, although **1010 participants** responded to it (almost everyone). Almost half of you (48%) said to be using an iOS device or have someone close who is using it. This is great news for a potential future expansion of Blokada to iOS.

Again, thank you for so active participation in another general voting of our community. The next survey is already online, and I encourage you to take part in it!
