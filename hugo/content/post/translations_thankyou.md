Blokada v2.0 is available in six languages. This is only possible thanks to the contributions of several awesome people! I wanted to publicly say thank you to everyone responsible:

- Spanish: **Wolf Igmc4**
- Portuguese: **vinicastro**, **RinaldiMe**
- French: **Emmanuel.Viollet**, **stephtban**
- Czech: **misacek**
- Polish: **ew.lapinska**
- English: well, whatever, it's just me ;)

So, thank you!
