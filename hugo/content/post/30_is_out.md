Blokada v3 is now released and I'm gradually rolling out the update to all users. If you haven't received it yet, stay tuned, or just go the [download section](https://blokada.org/#download).

This release is introducing a lot of changes and improvements, and you'll see all of them described in detail in next several posts. Meanwhile, here are the highlights:

- Improved "Keep Alive" feature. This is addressing the problem of Blokada being killed by the OS too often on some devices.
- Improved "Start of Boot" feature. Now Blokada starts earlier in boot and is more dependable.
- Introduced HTTPS to Blokada API and website to improve security and prevent MITM attacks.
- Introduced [Blokada Chat](http://go.blokada.org/chat). You are welcome to join us on Telegram!
- Introduced [Blokada Patron](http://go.blokada.org/patron). This feature aims to help supporting the project and at the same time reward contributions and active members of the community.
- Introduce "Chip In", a periodic Call to Action mechanism to engage the userbase and help make community decisions. As a first order of business, the Blokada community is having a vote to express their opinion on Blokada branding.
- Simplified and refreshed UI to eliminate confusing bits, keep the codebase nimble and decrease apk size.
- Simplified translating Blokada by decreasing the overall amount of strings, eliminating use of plural strings and keeping the core phrases set small.
- Fixed several significant bugs, for example with the whitelist.

A detailed changelog is always available at [go.blokada.org/changelog](http://go.blokada.org/changelog).

Thanks to the great team of Blokada translators, **Blokada v3 is translated to 15 languages from the start.** I can't emphasize enough how awesome it is, especially because it was done on a really short notice.

_Please note that some non-essential bits are still to be translated and you'll see more complete translations in coming days._
