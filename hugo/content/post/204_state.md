Two weeks after Blokada v2.0 was released, and 4 iterations later, the new and shiny Blokada v2.0.4 is the most stable release to date!

I'll be pushing updates to existing users incrementally over the coming days. You'll receive a notification as usual. If you don't want to wait, just use the download links on the website. Just remember to download proper version (if you have Android 4, use the secondary link).

The 2.0.4 update is a maintenance release, so there's not much to brag about feature wise, but I'm proud of how stable it is for me so far. I hope your experience is going to be the same! Please report back if you get any problems.

A quick summary of changes:

- Rework app connectivity / boot / startup behavior for significantly higher reliability
- Introduce "Online only" switch to let users control Blokada behavior on connectivity changes
- Add Malay translations (and improve Dutch and German integration)
- Minor bugfixes

Enjoy!
