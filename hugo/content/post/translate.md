Thank you for considering translating Blokada!

Blokada has a convenient translation system in place that is meant to make your job easier. You can find it at: [go.blokada.org/translate](http://go.blokada.org/translate).

### Getting started

Once you click the link, you'll see all languages Blokada is being translated to. Click on the language you speak in order to see the files and their translation status. You can either use the _"Translate All"_ button at the top, or choose any particular file you would like to translate. Once you are logged in, you can start translating.

Don't worry that you'll break something - in case your translation looks too different from the original (in terms of length or formatting), the system will warn you. Plus, we can always revert any change ðŸ˜‰. Also, usually it's OK if your translation is longer than the source, Blokada UI is made in a way that it should look just fine.

### Do I need to translate everything?

No. Files are sorted with the most important ones at the top. You'll see an up arrow next to the `High priority` files, and down arrow for `Low priority` files (at the bottom of the list).

Any language that has 100% coverage on `High priority` files is going to be included in the app.

### I'm not sure how to translate a string, what can I do?

Under the `Discussions` tab you will find all questions from other translators. Feel free to create a `New Topic` if you can't find the answer for your problem.

### When will my work show up in the app?

Each new release gets fresh translations. However, they have to be approved by the `Localisation Manager` of your language.

### Who is Localisation Manager?

Each language has a person taking care of the overall translation quality. This is often the person who contributed the most translations for given language and agreed to take the role. If you have proven yourself as a translator, you are welcome to [apply for this role]({{< relref "post/insiders.md" >}})!

### What if my language is not listed?

Just post a comment under this article, and I'll add your language to the list. You'll be asked to take the role of `Localisation Manager` for this language. Although it's not compulsory, languages without an active manager have a bit lower priority and may not always be included in new releases.
