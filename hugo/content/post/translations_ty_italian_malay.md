The awesome members of the Blokada community just contributed new translations! As of v2.2, Blokada adblocker is now available in two more languages: Italian and Malay. A thank you goes to:

- Italian: **htrex**
- Malay: **Syed**

This makes Blokada ad blocker speak 10 languages in total! Just a month after I've introduced translations support. What's more, Hebrew and Persian are already in the pipeline (I need some more testing for those since they're first RTL languages to be supported by Blokada). This is seriously impressive.

Great job everyone!
