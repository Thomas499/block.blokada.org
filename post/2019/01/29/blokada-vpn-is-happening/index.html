    <h1 class="post-title">Blokada VPN is happening!</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Jan 29, 2019 &middot; by Karol 
    </span>
    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since the last time I made a post, and that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been really busy putting a lot of things together, which I hope you&rsquo;ll find as exciting as I do. So, let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>

<p>First of all, I&rsquo;ve been working on the <strong>new User Interface of the app</strong>, which is going to fix many problems you&rsquo;ve been reporting, and allow us to be future-proof in terms of adding new functionality. The main goal of the new UI is to support a great variety of devices, from small-screen smartphones, through tablets, to smart TVs. The new UI is designed to work well in any orientation and on any screen size, and you&rsquo;ll be able to access all the functionality conveniently by using a TV remote. And, it&rsquo;ll come with the long-awaited feature of <strong>ad blocking log</strong> included!</p>

<p>Another goal of the new UI is to make the app more intuitive by exposing the most commonly used features. This is based on your feedback and the questions you are asking on our social media. I believe you&rsquo;ll find the app much more convenient to use!</p>

<p>Also, the new UI is designed to be hackable - contributors will be able to easily play with it and try out their ideas, which I hope is going to generate more contributions, and let the community have some fun! Finally, based on the early preview feedback, it looks aesthetically pleasing and fresh, so I hope it&rsquo;ll make you feel good using it. Especially since you&rsquo;ll be spending much more time in the app with all the new features that are coming! ;)</p>

<p>Speaking of new features, there&rsquo;s a big one coming. I&rsquo;m happy to say that a good friend of mine, who&rsquo;s an expert in network, backend, and cloud, has agreed to join me in our quest to <strong>make the Blokada VPN happen</strong>, and we both are super excited about it! We have already started research and design of the new feature, and since it&rsquo;s quite a challenge, we want to do it right. You may have seen the new survey in the app, that is designed to help us understand your VPN needs. Please take a minute to answer it - much appreciated!</p>

<p>The VPN rollout will take a few stages, with location-limited invite-only beta as the first step, to make sure we can monitor how our system handles the load, and fix any problems. then we&rsquo;ll expand our service gradually to more and more users. Of course, the Blokada community will be have the early access, with Donors and Insiders having priority. And yes, we&rsquo;re preparing some cool freebie thank-you offer for all who donated or helped the project significantly, since without your participation I couldn&rsquo;t have done any of this!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for details about the new UI and about the Blokada VPN, which will come in future posts.</p>
