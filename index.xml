      <description>Blokada 2.2 added a very useful quick actions menu to help you efficiently manage your whitelist. You can easily whitelist and un-whitelist all installed or system apps with one tap. You can also restore your filters to default configuration in case you messed it up too much. Note that it also resets the blacklist.
Here is a video that demonstrates the quick actions menu available in the Whitelist section.
 Keep in mind a few things while using this feature in it&amp;rsquo;s early release:</description>

      <description>Blokada 2.1 introduced a long-awaited app whitelisting feature. This is very useful for dealing with apps that do not work correctly with ad blocking. Some apps, like Google Play Store or GMail are whitelisted out of the box. As always, you have full control how Blokada ad blocker works, so you can easily add and delete whitelisted apps.
Here is a video that demonstrates app whitelisting with XDA Labs app, which used to have problems with downloading apps if Blokada was on.</description>

      <description>Two weeks after Blokada v2.0 was released, and 4 iterations later, the new and shiny Blokada v2.0.4 is the most stable release to date!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be pushing updates to existing users incrementally over the coming days. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive a notification as usual. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait, just use the download links on the website. Just remember to download proper version (if you have Android 4, use the secondary link).</description>

      <title>A state of Blokada v2.0</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since Blokada ad blocker is open sourced and available for free. Here is a short summary of the improvements introduced between versions 2.0 and 2.0.2.
I got great feedback from the XDA folks as usual, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been addressing reported problems as they come. The biggest issue was the stability around imminent network connectivity changes. Apparently, connectivity state events sent by the OS cannot always be trusted, so I introduced some mechanisms (including a watchdog) to make Blokada more aware of the actual state, while not killing the battery.</description>

      <description>Yes, Blokada v2.0 is out! With the source in the open! :D
This is a very important release for several reasons:
 Blokada is an open source project now. This has a lot of consequences - you can read about them here! Translations are supported, and v2.0 comes with 6 languages straight out of the box! Expect more in future releases (we have German and Dutch in the pipeline). You can also help translating the app to your language!</description>

      <title>Why is Blokada open source?</title>
      <link>http://block.blokada.org/post/2017/07/23/why-is-blokada-open-source/</link>

      <description>Starting with v2.0, Blokada is an open source project.
Why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the best approach for developing an ad blocker, and what does it mean for the future of Blokada and its users? Read on :)
So, why? Well, there&amp;rsquo;re many reasons. So far I have dedicated several months of my time to the development of this app. My plans towards Blokada weren&amp;rsquo;t (and aren&amp;rsquo;t!) limited to it being &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; an ad blocker, but I wanted to limit its initial functionality so that I can see, in reasonable time, if this app may gain enough traction.</description>

      <title>Blokada v2.0 roadmap</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been exciting several months for ad blocking on Android. When I started developing Blokada, it was just a side project of mine meant to test some less-known Android APIs and capabilities of the platform itself. At that time, the only existing ad blockers for Android were eating battery like crazy and slowing down device. Plus, they were quite cumbersome to use. I wanted to see if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to build something that will block most of the ads across all apps, while being efficient and fast enough so that I won&amp;rsquo;t notice it in terms of battery life, or network bandwidth speed or device performance.</description>
